# Monte Carlo Pi Implementation
This project demonstrates the calculation of PI using random numbers between 0 and 1.

It uses the Pythagoras of a random point between 0 and 1. If that is $\ge 1$, this means that the number is in the circle.

If we do this for a theoretical infinite of random points, we find out that $\pi\over{4}$ of the points are whithin the circle.
